      <description>The clock struck 9:30 pm IST on 23rd April, 2018. I had been extremely impatient for this day since I submitted my proposal for Google Summer of Code on 27th March 2018. I checked my dashboard on the GSoC website and it showed my status as Active. I was flummoxed after seeing it, as I did not really know what to comprehend - Am I selected ? or Am I not ?</description>

The first task assigned to me was writing a versatile install function for R API which will be at par in terms of functionalities of Python API. Earlier during my proposal preparation, I focussed on the need of configuration details required by databases such as PostgreSQL,MySQL,SQLite. For instance, they could be made available through, configuration file (custom made by user or default file) or in absence of this file, command the Retriever to use defaults from code base.</description>
