      <description>After in depth analysis and various permutations of testing environments, we figured out that in the journey to code check_retriever() function for rdataretriever package, the most difficult hurdle to overcome is not different operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS). Its actually the existance of different virtual environments in the system.
When there are more than one virtual environments in the system, a whole new spectrum of possibilities come into picture:</description>

      <title>Pursuit of Python</title>

      <description>Pursuit of Reticulate package in Windows is tricky than searching its installation in Ubuntu/Mac. Windows operating system has disintegrated structure for file storage. It also has different drives such as C,D etc. which can be the home for software installation. Over this layer of complicated file structure comes the different ways in which Python can be installed in the Windows OS. It can be a manual installation of python.exe or through frameworks such as Miniconda, Anaconda.</description>

      <description>It is been two weeks, since my last post about my GSoC selection. The first task assigned to me was writing a versatile install function for R API which will be at par in terms of functionalities of Python API. Earlier during my proposal preparation, I focussed on the need of configuration details required by databases such as PostgreSQL,MySQL,SQLite. For instance, they could be made available through, configuration file (custom made by user or default file) or in absence of this file, command the Retriever to use defaults from code base.</description>

      <description>The clock struck 9:30 pm IST on 23rd April, 2018. I had been extremely impatient for this day since I submitted my proposal for Google Summer of Code on 27th March 2018. I checked my dashboard on the GSoC website and it showed my status as Active. I was flummoxed after seeing it, as I did not really know what to comprehend - Am I selected ? or Am I not ?</description>
